<h1>Data Analysis of All Tools Explored & Efficiency</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Screen readers and screen magnifiers are the two biggest accessibility tools as incorporated and found in the majority of OS and Windows
  devices.
  Not only this, but in recent technology there are new ways to incorporate AI to make
  screen reading less cumbersome.
</p>

<h2> Case 1: Testing Efficiency of Different Methods of Accessible Tools </h2>

<p>
    ANALYSIS:
    This case focuses on testing two different approaches in a accessibility tool case study.
    When it comes to accessibility tools and issues that arise, designers have to determine
    which tools to build and develop. Using data collection, how can we determine which of these
    two tools is better to use?
    In many cases, developers utilize the design cycle, where at testing stages implement and test
    the usability and efficiency  of tools, run uer tests, go back and make changes, and continue.
</p>
<p>
    HOW TO LOOK AT THIS DATA:
    Here we see the number of seconds it takes users to complete the finding game in both cases.
    To understand which method works better, we need to think which allows the user to complete the
    task in the least amount of time.
    One of the main goals of accessibility is to allow users to save time and energy in the elements
    they need access to make things easier.
    In this case, looking at both, we need to compare which dataset has the higher count of the smaller
    amount of seconds.
    One thing to consider is, just because a tool saves us time, does this mean it is easier to use?
    There may be the case in which a tool is efficient and gets the job done,
    but the user interface, instructions, and personal bias prevents its usability.
    Go back to the homepage and checkout the feedback section to see ways to address this,
    also represented in results of Case 3 below.
</p>

<h2> Case 2: Testing Efficiency of Use of Accessible Tools vs Non-use </h2>

<br>
<br>
<p>
    ANALYSIS:
    This case focuses on testing whether or not accessibility is needed and if needed,
    should the use of personalization be used?
    We should aim for a common goal of accessibility across web design, and this allows
    awareness of how even within accessible tools being implemented there are still ways
    these technologies can be further improved to better suit the needs of the user.
    It is important to be aware of faults and drawbacks of accessibility solutions,
    just because a tool is present is not enough. We need to make sure it doesn't become
    detrimental to the user only for the sake of having accessibility in the first place.
</p>
<p>
    HOW TO LOOK AT THIS DATA:
    Here we see the accuracy scores of the games recorded and represented in both cases.
    The accuracy score ranges from 0 to 100. The higher the accuracy score,
    we can assume the better accuracy the tool has provided for the game or user.
    Take a look at both graphs, the trend with the higher curve can be
    seen as the efficient tool.
    However, again we must address bias. Some users may have difficult and different speeds
    and styles of typing and hearing interpretation. Some of the customization settings could
    have hender or helped the accuracy of the results depending on user intent and testing.
    Again, even if it had shown efficient results, it is important to look at also user
    experience and how they feel about the tasks, instructions, learning curve, bias,
    difficulties of the assignment. This can be further looked into using the feedback section and
    Case 4 found below.
</p>

<h2> Case 3: Results of Different Methods of Accessible Tools </h2>
<iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSiX_zPIbZ6_HAyJ_8uoZbvsWmUw7XXzGe9pfzxpT2oVFaFSd9oZpe_htODUTj8azVPH1hWu-SYuN_j/pubchart?oid=573077084&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    ANALYSIS:
    User base collected data is very important in testing and building accessible tools.
    In the design and development process cycle, it is crucial to gain user
    feedback and insight at every stage of development to go back and make changes, make
    more implementation, and establish use cases and purpose.
</p>
<p>
    HOW TO LOOK AT THIS DATA:
    The scale is from 1 to 5 (1 being lowest of satisfaction, 5 to being highest satisfaction).
    This time the data from the two use cases are compared side by side. Is this a better data
    representation compared to Case 1 from above?
    We want to look at the tool that has an overall trend of higher satisfaction to understand
    which tool was favored, not favored, or equally sparse.
</p>

<h2> Case 4: Results of Effective Uses of Accessible Tool </h2>

    ANALYSIS:
    User base collected data is very important in testing and building accessible tools.
    In the design and development process cycle, it is crucial to gain user
    feedback and insight at every stage of development to go back and make changes, make
    more implementation, and establish use cases and purpose.
</p>
<p>
    HOW TO LOOK AT THIS DATA:
    For the default speech option, no customization, the choice options are like, mah, dislike.
    For the custom case, the choice options are good, neutral, bad.
    How does the connotation and decision of option choice affect bias and understanding of the tools?
    To look at this data, we can compare the extent and rage of positive reviews across both cases.
    This way we can get a grip of the overall thoughts and satisfaction.
</p>
<h2> Case 5: Comments </h2>
<iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSiX_zPIbZ6_HAyJ_8uoZbvsWmUw7XXzGe9pfzxpT2oVFaFSd9oZpe_htODUTj8azVPH1hWu-SYuN_j/pubchart?oid=1915375552&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    ANALYSIS:
    Direct user feedback in accessibility is a great way to understand the need, use, and purpose of
    accessibility in webdesign.
    Allowing direct user feedback can be used to get direct comment on specific features.
    What are ways to make sure to know what the user knows?
    What are some ways to prevent bias in direct user input?
</p>
<p>
    HOW TO LOOK AT THIS DATA:
    Read through comments, address common and overall themes. Consider these in ways to improve the
    accessibility design and accessibility tools. What tools can be added, removes, improved on?
    What can be done differently?
