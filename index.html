<h1>Welcome to Accessibility Learning & Testing</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Screen readers and screen magnifiers are the two biggest accessibility tools as incorporated and found in the majority of OS and Windows
    devices.
    Not only this, but in recent technology there are new ways to incorporate AI to make
    screen reading less cumbersome.

    The site involves two case studies that involves the user to compare side by side the usability of accessibility tools versus not having them and a different range and forms to decide which are most efficient.
